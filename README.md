# **big_data_ecomerce_project**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in big data processing and analytics through three key phases:

1. **Data Extraction:** Utilize **PySpark** to efficiently extract and preprocess data from a semi-structured database **PostgreSQL**
2. **Data Analysis:** Apply appropriate **machine learning** techniques to analyze patterns or make predictions based on the extracted data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Present findings through meaningful and visually appealing representations using tools such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Power BI**.

## 📊 **Dataset Overview**

This project is based on the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). The dataset offers a comprehensive view of customer behavior and logistics performance in Brazil’s online retail space.
