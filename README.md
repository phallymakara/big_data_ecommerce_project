## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in big data processing and analytics through three key phases:

1. **Data Extraction:** Utilize **PySpark** to efficiently extract and preprocess data from a semi-structured database **PostgreSQL**
2. **Data Analysis:** Apply appropriate **machine learning** techniques to analyze patterns or make predictions based on the extracted data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Present findings through meaningful and visually appealing representations using tools such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Power BI**.
